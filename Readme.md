## About the project

We were provided with the base code for a media player and our goal was to make the process of the client consuming media content secure, with two main goals:

- Establish a secure connection between the client and the server;
- Manage authentication, access control and confinement.



## Technology stack

The code for this project was developed in Python, with the library [Cryptography.io](https://cryptography.io/). For authentication, we have used the Portuguese Citizen card has a token to validate the user identity.
